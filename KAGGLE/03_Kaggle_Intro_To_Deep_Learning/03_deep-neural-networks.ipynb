We've seen how a linear unit computes a linear function -- now we'll see how to combine and modify these single units to model more complex relationships.\n\n# Layers #\n\nNeural networks typically organize their neurons into **layers**. When we collect together linear units having a common set of inputs we get a **dense** layer.\n\n<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2MA4iMV.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"A stack of three circles in an input layer connected to two circles in a dense layer.\">\n<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>A dense layer of two linear units receiving two inputs and a bias.\n</center></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nYou could think of each layer in a neural network as performing some kind of relatively simple transformation. Through a deep stack of layers, a neural network can transform its inputs in more and more complex ways. In a well-trained neural network, each layer is a transformation getting us a little bit closer to a solution.\n\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto; background-color: #ebf9ff; padding: 1em; margin:24px;\">\n    <strong>Many Kinds of Layers</strong><br>\nA \"layer\" in Keras is a very general kind of thing. A layer can be, essentially, any kind of <em>data transformation</em>. Many layers, like the <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D\">convolutional</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/RNN\">recurrent</a> layers, transform data through use of neurons and differ primarily in the pattern of connections they form. Others though are used for <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding\">feature engineering</a> or just <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Add\">simple arithmetic</a>. There's a whole world of layers to discover -- <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers\">check them out</a>!\n</blockquote>\n\n# The Activation Function #\n\nIt turns out, however, that two dense layers with nothing in between are no better than a single dense layer by itself. Dense layers by themselves can never move us out of the world of lines and planes. What we need is something *nonlinear*. What we need are activation functions.\n\n<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OLSUEYT.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\" \">\n<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>Without activation functions, neural networks can only learn linear relationships. In order to fit curves, we'll need to use activation functions. \n</center></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAn **activation function** is simply some function we apply to each of a layer's outputs (its *activations*). The most common is the *rectifier* function $max(0, x)$.\n\n<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aeIyAlF.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"A graph of the rectifier function. The line y=x when x>0 and y=0 when x<0, making a 'hinge' shape like '_/'.\">\n<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>\n</center></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe rectifier function has a graph that's a line with the negative part \"rectified\" to zero. Applying the function to the outputs of a neuron will put a *bend* in the data, moving us away from simple lines.\n\nWhen we attach the rectifier to a linear unit, we get a **rectified linear unit** or **ReLU**. (For this reason, it's common to call the rectifier function the \"ReLU function\".)  Applying a ReLU activation to a linear unit means the output becomes `max(0, w * x + b)`, which we might draw in a diagram like:\n\n<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eFry7Yu.png\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Diagram of a single ReLU. Like a linear unit, but instead of a '+' symbol we now have a hinge '_/'. \">\n<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>A rectified linear unit.\n</center></figcaption>\n</figure>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Stacking Dense Layers #\n\nNow that we have some nonlinearity, let's see how we can stack layers to get complex data transformations.\n\n<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Y5iwFQZ.png\" width=\"450\" alt=\"An input layer, two hidden layers, and a final linear layer.\">\n<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>A stack of dense layers makes a \"fully-connected\" network.\n</center></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe layers before the output layer are sometimes called **hidden** since we never see their outputs directly.\n\nNow, notice that the final (output) layer is a linear unit (meaning, no activation function). That makes this network appropriate to a regression task, where we are trying to predict some arbitrary numeric value. Other tasks (like classification) might require an activation function on the output.\n\n## Building Sequential Models ##\n\nThe `Sequential` model we've been using will connect together a list of layers in order from first to last: the first layer gets the input, the last layer produces the output.
